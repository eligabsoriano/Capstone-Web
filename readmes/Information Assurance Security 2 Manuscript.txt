1. Executive Summary


1.1 Project Overview
MSME Pathways: Smart Loan Support for the Informal Sector is an AI-enabled financial guidance system designed to support Filipino microentrepreneurs—including sari-sari store owners, market vendors, home-based sellers, and informal workers—in accessing formal financial services.


The system addresses critical financial inclusion gaps by providing:
* AI-driven loan education in simple, culturally relevant language
* Smart pre-qualification engine using alternative data profiling
* Document recognition for streamlined application processing
* Financial literacy modules to build user confidence


1.2 System Scope
Included Components:
* Mobile Application (Android/iOS): User-facing interface with chatbot, document upload, and profile management
* Web Portal (React.js): Browser-based access for loan officers and admins
* Admin Dashboard: Loan officer management, analytics, and risk reports
* Backend API: Core business logic and AI-powered services
* Database Systems: MongoDB Atlas for PII, Redis for session data


Excluded Features (Out of Scope):
* Direct loan disbursement processing
* Integration with actual banking systems
* Real-time credit bureau integration


1.3 Security Objective
Security and threat modeling are critical for this system because:
* The system handles sensitive PII and financial data from economically vulnerable populations
* AI/ML models require protection against adversarial attacks and bias exploitation
* Mobile application security must account for low-end devices common in target demographics
* Compliance with BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) data privacy regulations is mandatory
* The system must protect against fraud while maintaining accessibility for underserved communities
2. System / Network Architecture

Component Interaction (Request-Response Flow)
1. Client initiates request → Encrypted via TLS 1.3
2. API Gateway receives request → Validates JWT, rate limits, and sanitizes input
3. Load Balancer routes to available → Application server
4. Application Service processes request → Business logic execution
5. Data Layer accessed if needed → Encrypted queries with RBAC
6. Response travels back → Same secure path to client

2.3 Trust Boundaries

Identify and explain trust boundaries between:
* Users and clients
* Clients and API
* API and database


Trust Boundary 1: Users and Clients
* This boundary separates human actors (Finance Department, Auditors, Regulators, Management) from the client interface (Frontend/Web Portal).
* All user-provided data (uploads, form inputs, filters, and requests) is treated as untrusted until validated.
* Authentication is required before access to role-specific client features.
* Authorization rules in the client must not be trusted alone; all sensitive actions are re-validated server-side.


Trust Boundary 2: Clients and API
* This boundary separates the Frontend client from Backend/API services.
* All client-to-API communication must use HTTPS/TLS to protect credentials, tokens, and business data in transit.
* API endpoints enforce JWT validation, role checks, rate limiting, and server-side input validation.
* Only approved request formats and authenticated calls are processed; malformed or unauthorized requests are rejected.


Trust Boundary 3: API and Database
* This boundary separates API/Application services from Invoice Database and Data Storage components.
* Direct database access from users/clients is prohibited; only backend services can read/write database records.
* Database credentials are stored in server environment configuration and are never exposed to clients.
* Data access is constrained by least privilege/RBAC policies, with logging/audit trails for sensitive operations.
* Query and write operations are validated/sanitized before database execution to reduce injection and tampering risk.


























3. Asset Identification

Critical Assets
List and describe key assets such as:
* User credentials
* Personal or sensitive data
* Authentication tokens
* Application source code

Asset 1: User Credentials
* Description: Email/username, password hashes, MFA secrets, and reset credentials
* Why critical: Compromise enables account takeover and unauthorized system access

Asset 2: Personal or Sensitive Data
* Description: PII, financial profile data, and uploaded identity/business documents
* Why critical: Exposure can lead to privacy harm, fraud, and compliance violations

Asset 3: Authentication Tokens
* Description: Access tokens, refresh tokens, and temporary session tokens
* Why critical: Theft or tampering can enable session hijacking and privilege abuse

Asset 4: Application Source Code
* Description: Frontend, backend API, and integration/business-logic source code
* Why critical: Leakage or tampering can expose vulnerabilities or introduce malicious behavior

CIA Triad Mapping
Map each asset to:
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

| Asset | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| User Credentials | Critical - Exposure enables account takeover | Critical - Credential tampering enables unauthorized access | High - Login/auth must remain available |
| Personal or Sensitive Data | Critical - PII/financial leakage impacts users and compliance | Critical - Data tampering causes wrong risk/loan decisions | High - Services depend on data availability |
| Authentication Tokens | High - Token theft enables session hijacking | Critical - Token manipulation enables privilege abuse | High - Token service outage blocks access |
| Application Source Code | High - Source exposure reveals attack paths | High - Code tampering may inject backdoors | Medium - Build/release disruption impacts operations |

4. STRIDE Threat Model (30%)

4.1 STRIDE Overview
STRIDE is a threat modeling framework with six categories:
* Spoofing: Illegitimately assuming the identity of a valid user, role, or service to bypass authentication controls and gain trusted access.
* Tampering: Altering data, requests, configurations, or executable code in transit or at rest, resulting in unauthorized or misleading system behavior.
* Repudiation: Disputing performed actions because system logs, timestamps, or identity evidence are incomplete, weak, or not tamper-resistant.
* Information Disclosure: Exposing confidential information to unauthorized entities through improper access control, insecure storage, or insecure transmission.
* Denial of Service: Reducing or blocking service availability by exhausting compute, network, storage, or application resources needed by legitimate users.
* Elevation of Privilege: Obtaining higher permissions than intended by abusing authorization flaws, role validation gaps, or trust assumptions.

Scoring Model (Likelihood and Impact)
* Likelihood score: 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High)
* Impact score: 1 (Low) to 5 (Critical)
* Risk Score = Likelihood x Impact
* Risk Level:
  - 1-5 = Low
  - 6-10 = Medium
  - 11-15 = High
  - 16-25 = Critical

4.2 STRIDE Threat Table

| System Component | STRIDE Category | Threat Description | Impact (1-5) | Likelihood (1-5) | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authentication Service | Spoofing | Attacker impersonates a valid user using stolen credentials/tokens | 5 | 3 | High (15) | MFA, strong password policy, short-lived tokens, lockout/rate limits |
| Loan Application API | Tampering | Request parameter manipulation alters loan eligibility outcomes | 5 | 4 | Critical (20) | Server-side validation/calculation, signed critical actions, integrity checks |
| Audit Logging Service | Repudiation | User/admin denies performing actions due to weak/non-verifiable logs | 4 | 3 | High (12) | Immutable timestamped logs, actor ID capture, tamper-evident retention |
| Profile and Document APIs | Information Disclosure | Unauthorized access/IDOR exposes PII and sensitive documents | 5 | 4 | Critical (20) | Object-level authorization, RBAC enforcement, masking/minimization |
| API Gateway | Denial of Service | Flooding or abusive traffic degrades system response and availability | 4 | 4 | Critical (16) | Rate limiting, WAF/CDN, autoscaling, circuit breaker controls |
| Admin Access Control | Elevation of Privilege | Non-admin user gains officer/admin capabilities via broken authorization | 5 | 3 | High (15) | Least privilege RBAC, defense-in-depth authz checks, privilege separation |

4.3 Threat Prioritization

Threats were ranked using a likelihood-versus-impact matrix where Risk Score = Likelihood x Impact. Higher scores were prioritized first because they represent threats that are both more probable and more damaging to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Highest-risk threats
* Tampering in Loan Application API (Score 20, Critical)
* Information Disclosure in Profile and Document APIs (Score 20, Critical)
* Denial of Service in API Gateway (Score 16, Critical)

Medium-risk threats
* None identified in the current STRIDE scope using the defined scoring bands.

Low-risk threats
* None identified in the current STRIDE scope using the defined scoring bands.

Top 3 Priorities Based on Context:
1. A01 (Broken Access Control): Critical because the system has three distinct roles with vastly different permissions—a regular user accessing loan officer data would be catastrophic.
2. A07 (Identification & Authentication Failures): Critical for mobile-first design, where users may have weak passwords and devices are often shared in informal sector contexts
3. A02 (Cryptographic Failures): Critical given the sensitivity of financial and identity data from economically vulnerable populations ---
