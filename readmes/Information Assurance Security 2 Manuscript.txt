1. Executive Summary


1.1 Project Overview
MSME Pathways: Smart Loan Support for the Informal Sector is an AI-enabled financial guidance system designed to support Filipino microentrepreneurs—including sari-sari store owners, market vendors, home-based sellers, and informal workers—in accessing formal financial services.


The system addresses critical financial inclusion gaps by providing:
* AI-driven loan education in simple, culturally relevant language
* Smart pre-qualification engine using alternative data profiling
* Document recognition for streamlined application processing
* Financial literacy modules to build user confidence


1.2 System Scope
Included Components:
* Mobile Application (Android/iOS): User-facing interface with chatbot, document upload, and profile management
* Web Portal (React.js): Browser-based access for loan officers and admins
* Admin Dashboard: Loan officer management, analytics, and risk reports
* Backend API: Core business logic and AI-powered services
* Database Systems: MongoDB Atlas for PII, Redis for session data


Excluded Features (Out of Scope):
* Direct loan disbursement processing
* Integration with actual banking systems
* Real-time credit bureau integration


1.3 Security Objective
Security and threat modeling are critical for this system because:
* The system handles sensitive PII and financial data from economically vulnerable populations
* AI/ML models require protection against adversarial attacks and bias exploitation
* Mobile application security must account for low-end devices common in target demographics
* Compliance with BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) data privacy regulations is mandatory
* The system must protect against fraud while maintaining accessibility for underserved communities

Component Interaction (Request-Response Flow)
1. Client initiates request → Encrypted via TLS 1.3
2. API Gateway receives request → Validates JWT, rate limits, and sanitizes input
3. Load Balancer routes to available → Application server
4. Application Service processes request → Business logic execution
5. Data Layer accessed if needed → Encrypted queries with RBAC
6. Response travels back → Same secure path to client

2.3 Trust Boundaries

Identify and explain trust boundaries between:
* Users and clients
* Clients and API
* API and database


Trust Boundary 1: Users and Clients
* This boundary separates human actors (Finance Department, Auditors, Regulators, Management) from the client interface (Frontend/Web Portal).
* All user-provided data (uploads, form inputs, filters, and requests) is treated as untrusted until validated.
* Authentication is required before access to role-specific client features.
* Authorization rules in the client must not be trusted alone; all sensitive actions are re-validated server-side.


Trust Boundary 2: Clients and API
* This boundary separates the Frontend client from Backend/API services.
* All client-to-API communication must use HTTPS/TLS to protect credentials, tokens, and business data in transit.
* API endpoints enforce JWT validation, role checks, rate limiting, and server-side input validation.
* Only approved request formats and authenticated calls are processed; malformed or unauthorized requests are rejected.


Trust Boundary 3: API and Database
* This boundary separates API/Application services from Invoice Database and Data Storage components.
* Direct database access from users/clients is prohibited; only backend services can read/write database records.
* Database credentials are stored in server environment configuration and are never exposed to clients.
* Data access is constrained by least privilege/RBAC policies, with logging/audit trails for sensitive operations.
* Query and write operations are validated/sanitized before database execution to reduce injection and tampering risk.


























3. Asset Identification

Critical Assets
List and describe key assets such as:
* User credentials
* Personal or sensitive data
* Authentication tokens
* Application source code

Asset 1: User Credentials
* Description: Email/username, password hashes, MFA secrets, and reset credentials
* Why critical: Compromise enables account takeover and unauthorized system access

Asset 2: Personal or Sensitive Data
* Description: PII, financial profile data, and uploaded identity/business documents
* Why critical: Exposure can lead to privacy harm, fraud, and compliance violations

Asset 3: Authentication Tokens
* Description: Access tokens, refresh tokens, and temporary session tokens
* Why critical: Theft or tampering can enable session hijacking and privilege abuse

Asset 4: Application Source Code
* Description: Frontend, backend API, and integration/business-logic source code
* Why critical: Leakage or tampering can expose vulnerabilities or introduce malicious behavior

CIA Triad Mapping
Map each asset to:
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

| Asset | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| User Credentials | Critical - Exposure enables account takeover | Critical - Credential tampering enables unauthorized access | High - Login/auth must remain available |
| Personal or Sensitive Data | Critical - PII/financial leakage impacts users and compliance | Critical - Data tampering causes wrong risk/loan decisions | High - Services depend on data availability |
| Authentication Tokens | High - Token theft enables session hijacking | Critical - Token manipulation enables privilege abuse | High - Token service outage blocks access |
| Application Source Code | High - Source exposure reveals attack paths | High - Code tampering may inject backdoors | Medium - Build/release disruption impacts operations |

4. STRIDE Threat Model (30%)

4.1 STRIDE Overview
STRIDE is a threat modeling framework with six categories:
* Spoofing: Illegitimately assuming the identity of a valid user, role, or service to bypass authentication controls and gain trusted access.
* Tampering: Altering data, requests, configurations, or executable code in transit or at rest, resulting in unauthorized or misleading system behavior.
* Repudiation: Disputing performed actions because system logs, timestamps, or identity evidence are incomplete, weak, or not tamper-resistant.
* Information Disclosure: Exposing confidential information to unauthorized entities through improper access control, insecure storage, or insecure transmission.
* Denial of Service: Reducing or blocking service availability by exhausting compute, network, storage, or application resources needed by legitimate users.
* Elevation of Privilege: Obtaining higher permissions than intended by abusing authorization flaws, role validation gaps, or trust assumptions.

Scoring Model (Likelihood and Impact)
* Likelihood score: 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High)
* Impact score: 1 (Low) to 5 (Critical)
* Risk Score = Likelihood x Impact
* Risk Level:
  - 1-5 = Low
  - 6-10 = Medium
  - 11-15 = High
  - 16-25 = Critical

4.2 STRIDE Threat Table

| System Component | STRIDE Category | Threat Description | Impact (1-5) | Likelihood (1-5) | Risk Level | Mitigation | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authentication Service | Spoofing | Attacker impersonates a valid user using stolen credentials/tokens | 5 | 3 | High (15) | MFA, strong password policy, short-lived tokens, lockout/rate limits | IAM and Auth Team Lead | 2FA required for admin/officer logins; 5 failed attempts trigger lockout/rate limit; tampered/expired token tests fail with 401/redirect and no unauthorized access |
| Loan Application API | Tampering | Request parameter manipulation alters loan eligibility outcomes | 5 | 4 | Critical (20) | Server-side validation/calculation, signed critical actions, integrity checks | Backend API Lead (Loans Module) | Eligibility is computed server-side only; schema and business-rule validation reject modified payloads; unauthorized value changes are logged and return 4xx |
| Audit Logging Service | Repudiation | User/admin denies performing actions due to weak/non-verifiable logs | 4 | 3 | High (12) | Immutable timestamped logs, actor ID capture, tamper-evident retention | Security and Compliance Officer | All privileged actions include actor, role, timestamp, source IP, and action ID; logs are append-only/immutable for retention window; log export and review workflow is testable and repeatable |
| Profile and Document APIs | Information Disclosure | Unauthorized access/IDOR exposes PII and sensitive documents | 5 | 4 | Critical (20) | Object-level authorization, RBAC enforcement, masking/minimization | Data Protection and Backend Lead | IDOR tests across user IDs return 403/404 with no foreign records; PII fields are masked for unauthorized roles; document access requires valid scoped permission/token |
| API Gateway | Denial of Service | Flooding or abusive traffic degrades system response and availability | 4 | 4 | Critical (16) | Rate limiting, WAF/CDN, autoscaling, circuit breaker controls | DevOps and SRE Lead | Per-IP and per-endpoint limits return 429 during bursts; service remains available for legitimate traffic under load tests; alerts are generated for sustained anomalous traffic |
| Admin Access Control | Elevation of Privilege | Non-admin user gains officer/admin capabilities via broken authorization | 5 | 3 | High (15) | Least privilege RBAC, defense-in-depth authz checks, privilege separation | RBAC Owner (Admin Platform Team) | Non-admin tokens cannot access admin routes/endpoints; permission checks are enforced at route and API layers; admin role/permission changes generate audit entries and require authorized admin credentials |

4.2.1 Risk Justification Basis
Risk scoring is based on the threat scenario in the Threat Description (one score per STRIDE row). System Component identifies where the threat occurs, and STRIDE Category identifies the threat type.

Impact Assessment Method:

Highest-risk threats
* Tampering in Loan Application API (Score 20, Critical)
* Information Disclosure in Profile and Document APIs (Score 20, Critical)
* Denial of Service in API Gateway (Score 16, Critical)

Medium-risk threats
* None identified in the current STRIDE scope using the defined scoring bands.

Low-risk threats
* None identified in the current STRIDE scope using the defined scoring bands.

5. Mapping to OWASP Top 10

5.1 Relevant OWASP Risks
Applicable OWASP risks identified for this system are:
* Broken Authentication (A07: Identification and Authentication Failures) - Weak credential controls or session handling can allow account takeover and unauthorized login.
* Broken Access Control (A01) - Improper role and permission enforcement can expose admin-only functions or other users' data.
* Injection (A03) - Malicious or unvalidated input can alter backend processing, queries, or business logic outcomes.
* Cryptographic Failures (A02) - Poor protection of secrets, tokens, and sensitive data can lead to data exposure in storage or transit.
* Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (A09) - Inadequate audit trails and alerting make attacks harder to detect, investigate, and contain.
* Insecure Design (A04) - Missing security-by-design controls can leave systemic weaknesses across APIs and workflows.
* Security Misconfiguration (A05) - Unsafe defaults or weak environment hardening can increase exploitability of otherwise manageable issues.

These categories were selected because they directly map to the STRIDE threats in Section 4 and affect critical assets (user credentials, personal/sensitive data, authentication tokens, and application source code).

For MSME Pathways specifically, threat modeling ensures that the sensitive financial data of economically vulnerable microentrepreneurs is protected at every stage of the system.


8.3 Next Steps for Refinement


Immediate Actions (Sprint 1):
* Implement MFA for the mobile app and admin portal
* Deploy input validation and request signing for APIs
* Configure field-level encryption for PII
* Establish comprehensive audit logging


Short-Term Actions (Sprint 2-3):
* Conduct penetration testing on critical components
* Implement ML model input validation and anomaly detection
* Deploy mobile app hardening (code obfuscation, certificate pinning)
* Complete RBAC implementation across all endpoints


Ongoing Actions:
* Regular security assessments and threat model updates
* Continuous vulnerability scanning and patching
* Security awareness training for the development team
* Incident response plan testing and refinement
