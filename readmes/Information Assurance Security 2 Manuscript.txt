1. Executive Summary


1.1 Project Overview
MSME Pathways: Smart Loan Support for the Informal Sector is an AI-enabled financial guidance system designed to support Filipino microentrepreneurs—including sari-sari store owners, market vendors, home-based sellers, and informal workers—in accessing formal financial services.


The system addresses critical financial inclusion gaps by providing:
* AI-driven loan education in simple, culturally relevant language
* Smart pre-qualification engine using alternative data profiling
* Document recognition for streamlined application processing
* Financial literacy modules to build user confidence


1.2 System Scope
Included Components:
* Mobile Application (Android/iOS): User-facing interface with chatbot, document upload, and profile management
* Web Portal (React.js): Browser-based access for loan officers and admins
* Admin Dashboard: Loan officer management, analytics, and risk reports
* Backend API: Core business logic and AI-powered services
* Database Systems: MongoDB Atlas for PII, Redis for session data


Excluded Features (Out of Scope):
* Direct loan disbursement processing
* Integration with actual banking systems
* Real-time credit bureau integration


1.3 Security Objective
Security and threat modeling are critical for this system because:
* The system handles sensitive PII and financial data from economically vulnerable populations
* AI/ML models require protection against adversarial attacks and bias exploitation
* Mobile application security must account for low-end devices common in target demographics
* Compliance with BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) data privacy regulations is mandatory
* The system must protect against fraud while maintaining accessibility for underserved communities
2. System / Network Architecture

Component Interaction (Request-Response Flow)
1. Client initiates request → Encrypted via TLS 1.3
2. API Gateway receives request → Validates JWT, rate limits, and sanitizes input
3. Load Balancer routes to available → Application server
4. Application Service processes request → Business logic execution
5. Data Layer accessed if needed → Encrypted queries with RBAC
6. Response travels back → Same secure path to client

2.3 Trust Boundaries

Identify and explain trust boundaries between:
* Users and clients
* Clients and API
* API and database


Trust Boundary 1: Users and Clients
* This boundary separates human actors (Finance Department, Auditors, Regulators, Management) from the client interface (Frontend/Web Portal).
* All user-provided data (uploads, form inputs, filters, and requests) is treated as untrusted until validated.
* Authentication is required before access to role-specific client features.
* Authorization rules in the client must not be trusted alone; all sensitive actions are re-validated server-side.


Trust Boundary 2: Clients and API
* This boundary separates the Frontend client from Backend/API services.
* All client-to-API communication must use HTTPS/TLS to protect credentials, tokens, and business data in transit.
* API endpoints enforce JWT validation, role checks, rate limiting, and server-side input validation.
* Only approved request formats and authenticated calls are processed; malformed or unauthorized requests are rejected.


Trust Boundary 3: API and Database
* This boundary separates API/Application services from Invoice Database and Data Storage components.
* Direct database access from users/clients is prohibited; only backend services can read/write database records.
* Database credentials are stored in server environment configuration and are never exposed to clients.
* Data access is constrained by least privilege/RBAC policies, with logging/audit trails for sensitive operations.
* Query and write operations are validated/sanitized before database execution to reduce injection and tampering risk.

4. STRIDE Threat Model


4.1 STRIDE Overview
STRIDE is a threat modeling methodology developed by Microsoft that categorizes threats into six types:
* Spoofing Identity: Pretending to be someone or something else
* Example: Attacker using stolen credentials to impersonate a user
* Tampering with Data: Unauthorized modification of data
* Example: Altering credit scores in the database
* Repudiation: Denying that an action took place
* Example: User denying they submitted a loan application
* Information Disclosure: Exposing information to unauthorized parties
* Example: PII leaked through an API vulnerability
* Denial of Service: Making the system unavailable
* Example: DDoS attack overwhelming the API gateway
* Elevation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized access levels
* Example: Regular user accessing admin functions

Top 3 Priorities Based on Context:
1. A01 (Broken Access Control): Critical because the system has three distinct roles with vastly different permissions—a regular user accessing loan officer data would be catastrophic.
2. A07 (Identification & Authentication Failures): Critical for mobile-first design, where users may have weak passwords and devices are often shared in informal sector contexts
3. A02 (Cryptographic Failures): Critical given the sensitivity of financial and identity data from economically vulnerable populations ---


























6. Security Controls and Mitigations
6.1 Preventive Controls

* Encrypted SharedPreferences on mobile devices
* Secure key management with rotation policies


Access Controls:
* Least privilege principle enforcement
* Privilege separation between roles
* Authorization checks at all application layers
* User context validation for every request


6.2 Detective Controls


Logging:
* Comprehensive audit logging for all actions
* Immutable log storage (blockchain-backed for critical actions)
* Log sanitization with automatic PII redaction
* Centralized log management with SIEM integration


Monitoring:
* Real-time threat detection and alerting
* Anomaly detection for ML model inputs
* Rate limiting, monitoring, and DDoS detection
* User behavior analytics for fraud detection


Error Handling:
* Generic error messages to users (no sensitive data exposure)
* Detailed error logging for administrators
* Graceful degradation for service failures
* Circuit breaker pattern for cascading failure prevention


6.3 Defense-in-Depth


Layer 1 - Perimeter:
* Controls: DDoS protection, CDN, firewall
* Technologies: Atlas, NGINX, rate limiting
* Purpose: Block malicious traffic before it reaches the application


Layer 2 - Application:
* Controls: Input validation, authentication, authorization
* Technologies: OWASP ESAPI, JWT, RBAC
* Purpose: Enforce business logic security


Layer 3 - Data:
* Controls: Encryption, masking, access controls
* Technologies: AES-256, field-level encryption, MongoDB access controls
* Purpose: Protect data at rest and in use


Layer 4 - Endpoint:
* Controls: Mobile app hardening, integrity checks
* Technologies: ProGuard, certificate pinning, code obfuscation
* Purpose: Secure client-side applications


Layer 5 - User:
* Controls: MFA, security awareness, least privilege
* Technologies: TOTP, RBAC, user education modules
* Purpose: Reduce human-factor vulnerabilities


Cross-Layer Security:
* Each layer operates independently
* Compromise of one layer does not guarantee access to the next
* Detection opportunities exist at each boundary

Scope Limitations:
* This threat model covers the initial release; updates are needed as the system evolves
* Integration with external banking APIs requires a separate security assessment
* Regulatory compliance in other jurisdictions is not addressed
* Long-term key management and cryptographic agility are not fully defined
































































8. Conclusion


8.1 Key Security Risks Identified
This threat modeling exercise identified 21 specific threats across all STRIDE categories, with 4 rated as CRITICAL requiring immediate attention:
1. S-01 (Credential Theft): High likelihood of attackers targeting mobile app authentication
2. T-02 (API Parameter Manipulation): Critical risk of loan eligibility score tampering
3. I-01 (PII Exposure): Sensitive data from vulnerable populations at risk
4. E-02 (Horizontal Privilege Escalation): Users potentially accessing other users' data
The analysis also mapped threats to OWASP Top 10, identifying A01 (Broken Access Control), A02 (Cryptographic Failures), and A07 (Authentication Failures) as the highest-priority categories.


8.2 Value of Threat Modeling
* This systematic threat modeling provides:
* Proactive identification of vulnerabilities before deployment
* Prioritized security roadmap for development sprints
* Compliance alignment with BSP Circular 982, NIST SP 800-53, and ISO 27001
